🚀 Phishing Website Detection using Machine Learning & Deep Learning
📄 Overview
With the exponential growth of online activity, phishing attacks have become a major cybersecurity threat, putting both individuals and organizations at serious risk. This project presents a robust solution using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to detect phishing websites with high accuracy and efficiency.

🔍 What We Did
We analyzed two extensive datasets (30 and 87 features respectively) containing network traffic data, URL characteristics, and site content indicators. Our approach involved:

5 Machine Learning models and 3 Deep Learning models for binary classification.

Pearson Correlation for feature selection, reducing noise and redundancy in the datasets.

Hyperparameter tuning and 10-fold cross-validation for performance optimization.

🏆 Key Results
Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy (🚀 97.83%) on the smaller dataset.

XGBoost outperformed others on the larger dataset with an accuracy of 97.02%.

Feature selection significantly boosted model performance while minimizing input complexity.

✅ Highlights
📊 Binary classification of phishing vs. legitimate websites

⚙️ Feature reduction with Pearson correlation

🔁 10-fold cross-validation for model robustness

📈 High prediction accuracy using ML/DL

🔐 A step forward in real-time phishing detection
